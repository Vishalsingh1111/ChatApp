# ChatApp/Typescript

This project is a pretty full-stack chat app built with React and Typesctipt.



## Setup

Go to [chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io) and create your own project. There you will get a Project ID and Private Key which are needed for user signup and authentication.

### `.env.local`

Create a `.env.local` file at the top-level of your project, and replace the UUIDs with your own Project ID and Private Key from [chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io).


This will link your new React App to the right Chat Engine project.

### `npm install`

Build out your node modules by running `npm install`. Then you cn start the app.

### `npm run start`

This will start the app. By default it will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
